## 🏁 Conclusion

1. **Legal compliance** is non-negotiable
2. **Analytics** needed for any serious business
3. **Case studies** critical for conversion

With these additions, the site will be ready to generate leads and support business growth.

### Recommendation
Focus on the "Day 1" critical path items first, then iterate based on real user data rather than trying to perfect everything before launch.
